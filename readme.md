# Problem Objective <br>

Data Analysis using Power BI
Create a Report that gives the insights on a fictional haulage bussiness covering the employee productivity, most moved product(most profitable product), revenue, expenses and profit generated by product,drivers and depot and destination visited. 
Including a year over year analysis.

# Tools used in actualizing the project

Power Bi<br>
Excel<br>
Notepad<br>

# Data Transformation & Modeling

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
### - Step 1
After importing the datasets using the import method in power bi:<br>
Then, the first task i did was to clean the data by renaming misspelt values in columns, changing data-types and splitting the date-time columns (in tables that had them) to increase performance.<br>
<br/>
![applied steps 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92920156/194769932-eaf39578-461a-4dca-b480-a8b502cdd211.jpg)

Then I used excel to create a new table including just a column named total truck trip by copy the truck trip id from both closed and open trips into a single column. This was done to create a better relationship between this two columns.<br>
### Note
I didn't append both tables because they had little structural differences.
Then i imported this newly created table which i named destinations into power bi (note: I later used this table as my fact table. Forgive me for the wrong choice of name)

### - Step 2
I created a primary key in all the initial five tables to enable creating relationship with the destination table easier.<br>
Then I merged the already imported Destination tables (fact table) with other tables to create a table with more than 10 columns aside the secondary keys. <br>
Which Includes:
- Truck Trip Id
- Total Truck No
- Trip Status (conataining value indicating if the trip is closed or opem)
- Product type
- Truck Capacity
- Truck Classification 
- Depot Location
- Trip Rate
- Loading Expenses
- Trip Allowances
- Union Fees
- Destination (three columns- Destination name, Latitude and Longitude)
- Secondary Keys
