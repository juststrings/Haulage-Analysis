# Data Transformation & Modeling

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
### - Step 1
After importing the datasets using the import method in power bi:
Then, the first task i did was to clean the data by renaming misspelt values in columns, changing data-types and splitting the date-time columns (in tables that had them) to increase performance.<br>
<br/>
![applied steps 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92920156/194769932-eaf39578-461a-4dca-b480-a8b502cdd211.jpg)

Then I used excel to create a new table including just a column named total truck trip by copy the truck trip id from both closed and open trips into a single column. This was done to create a better relationship between this two columns.<br>
### Note
I didnt append because both tables had little structural differences.
Then i imported this newly created table which i named destinations into power bi (note i later used this table as my fact table. Forgive me for the wrong choice of name)
